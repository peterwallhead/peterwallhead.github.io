    <description>I'm currently mechanising the prototype of my scaled up flexible robot arm (commonly called a spine robot).</description>

    <description>After an extended holiday in Wellington, New Zealand, I'm getting back into making my mechanical creations. My next project is a flexible robot arm that will be able to operate in a inverted dome-shaped workspace.</description>

    <title>Human-robot Interaction: Ultrasonic Sensor Controlled Robotic Arm</title>
    <link>http://blog.peterwallhead.com/human-robot-interaction-ultrasonic-sensor-controlled-robotic-arm.html</link>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.peterwallhead.com/human-robot-interaction-ultrasonic-sensor-controlled-robotic-arm.html</guid>
    <description>The goal of this project was to demonstrate that by mounting the 4 Ping sensors to the gripper of the arm its motors could be controlled to direct the arm towards the closest target object (within 15cm in this case). Target objects could include one's hand or any flat surface measuring a minimum of 5cm by 5cm.</description>

      <description>I've recently put together these almost identical twin robots to test some community behaviour programs, such as follow the leader. Each robot is controlled by an Arduino Uno R3 board with a 1 Amp motor shield and powered by a 6V battery pack.</description>

      <title>Obstacle Avoidance Using An Ultrasonic Array</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://blog.peterwallhead.com/obstacle-avoidance-using-an-ultrasonic-array.html</guid>
      <description>Building on from my work in my last post, I purchased another 2 ultrasonic distance sensors and added some additional logic to my existing code to make it easier for the robot to avoid obstacles in its path.</description>

      <title>Simple Ultrasonic Obstacle Avoidance</title>

      <description>Inspired by an article by John Boxall for Little Bird Electronics I recently bought myself a Parallax Ping))) Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to try out. This great little sensor can measure distances between ~2cm and ~3m in length.</description>

      <title>Homemade Arduino Controlled Servo</title>

      <description>Even though one can easily buy hobby servos online, I thought I'd have a go at making, and programming, one with some spare parts I had laying around to see how they tick.</description>
