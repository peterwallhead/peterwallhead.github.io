				<p>I've had a robot arm sitting around for a few years and kept telling myself I'd dust it off and use it for a cool project, but never got to it until now.</p>

                <p>The goal of this project was to demonstrate that by mounting the 4 Ping sensors to the gripper of the arm its motors could be controlled to direct the arm towards the closest target object (within 15cm in this case). Target objects could include one's hand or any flat surface measuring a minimum of 5cm by 5cm.</p>

				<p>I've recently put together these almost identical twin robots to test some community behaviour programs, such as follow the leader. Each robot is controlled by an Arduino Uno R3 board with a 1 Amp motor shield and powered by a 6V battery pack.</p>

				<p>Building on from my work in my last post, I purchased another 2 ultrasonic distance sensors and added some additional logic to my existing code to make it easier for the robot to avoid obstacles in its path.</p>
				<p>The new program allows the robot to act in 2 different modes depending on the direction the obstacle is in. I've called these modes Passive Avoidance and Active Avoidance.</p>

				<p>Inspired by an article by John Boxall for Little Bird Electronics I recently bought myself a Parallax Ping))) Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to try out. This great little sensor can measure distances between ~2cm and ~3m in length.</p>
				<p>Having already purchased a motor base previously I decided to have a go at making a basic roving platform that could avoid obstacles in its path.</p>

				<p>Even though one can easily buy hobby servos online, I thought I'd have a go at making, and programming, one with some spare parts I had laying around to see how they tick.</p>
				<p>In its simplest form a servo is an electric motor with an encoder or potentiometer attached to the motor's shaft to measure its rotational angle. A microcontroller is used to to control the rotation speed and direction of the motor's shaft until its position matches a predefined angle as measured by the potentiometer.</p>
